### About Me
I'm passionate about products. I like talking to customers (literary reviews, surveys, interviews, lurking reddit forums etc), gathering data ( python, R, CSV, Excel ) always back things up with facts ), ideating potential solutions ( Azure Dev Ops, Notion ), writing out features( user stories, features, backlog ), designing ( especially love this phase, I'm an expert at Figma ( components, auto-layout, plug-ins, motion design I'm familiar ), front-end ( React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS ) and back-end ( SQL, Firebase, fetch! ). I've tried incorporating new technologies to optimize my work-flow ( agentic-ai, vibe-coding etc ). Always looking for ways to turn ideas into reality! I also love reading tech news/watching videos to keep up with what new technologies in trend!

I also like talking!
